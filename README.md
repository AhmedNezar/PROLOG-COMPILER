# PROLOG-COMPILER
This repository contains a project for implementing a lexical and syntax analyzer for a subset of the PROLOG programming language. The project involves designing and developing a scanner (lexical analyzer) and a parser (syntax analyzer) based on the specified grammar and language rules. Additionally, the project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for valid tokens and the parse tree.
